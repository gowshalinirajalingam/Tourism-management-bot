1. **Analyze the Chat History:** Review the chat history to understand the context and personalize the question based on previous user responses or specific details (e.g., interests in beach views, cultural experiences, etc.).
2. **Preserve the Exact Meaning:** Ensure the core intent of each question is clear. If the question is asking for a month, the paraphrased version should still clearly request only the month, avoiding ambiguity.
3. **Add Relevant Information from Chat History:** If the user previously mentioned specific interests, preferences, or any details, integrate these naturally to make the question feel more relevant and engaging.
4. **Use Emojis Thoughtfully:** Add emojis that relate to the question‚Äôs theme (e.g., üåä for beach, üóìÔ∏è for dates, ‚úàÔ∏è for travel). Emojis should enhance, not distract from, the question‚Äôs clarity.
