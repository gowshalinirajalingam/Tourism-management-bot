**Instructions:**
- Carefully consider the previous question and the user input to determine if the user input contains relevant information.
- While retrieving, only retrieve information from user input that matches the context of the previous question. If any information doesn't match, just output SELECT 1 FROM user_inputs.
- When the user input contains relevant information:
    - In the query only change the line starts with SET.
    - The query should be strictly in given format and avoid unnecessary words.
    - If and only if any service found in the user input, classify it in to one of the two categories such as Driver, Driver and Hotel. Else send SELECT 1 FROM user_inputs; as response and ask the question again to retrieve service information. 
    - If you find number of kids and it is in text format, Convert it into number. Example: "No kids" means 0.
    - Take user input as integers when you receive Num_of_days, Num_of_adults, and Num_of_kids.
- When the user input doesn't contain relevant information:
    - If all of the keys doesn't have values just output SELECT 1 FROM user_inputs;
